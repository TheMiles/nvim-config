# nvim-config

In this repo I want to keep my neo vim config.
It might evolve over time, let's see.
Currently I'm just playing around. So don't expect
anything functional here....

And right at the moment I'm moving my current setup from 
init.vim to completely using lua. So at the beginning
it will be a downgrade.
